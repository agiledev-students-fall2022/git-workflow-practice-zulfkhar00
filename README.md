I find [this](https://www.axios.com/2022/09/12/meta-pytorch-linux-foundation) article interesting because now PyTorch is more open source and many people can use it.

# Interesting article ðŸ‘€ #

* Facebook parent Meta is shifting its PyTorch AI tools, which are already available under open source license, to an outside governance model overseen by a new independent board under the auspices of the Linux Foundation ðŸ¥³

* Why it matters: The move will give the code more independence from Meta and also give a broader voice to other big partners, including Google and Amazon ðŸ‘»

An interesting move on Meta's part. I'm happy about the following:
1. Pytorch â€” a great machine learning framework â€” is moving under the aegis of the Linux Foundation.
2. None of the code is changing. Always good to know that I won't need to learn something over again ðŸ˜†

* Although Pytorch has moved to governance by Linux, most of the other big open source projects at Meta (e.g. React) are continuing to be maintained in house.
